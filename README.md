**Dataset and Model Training**

This project utilizes the TMNIST dataset from Kaggle to train a model for detecting individual letters (H, e, l, o, W, r, d, and !). Additionally, a custom dataset was created, which includes image paths, font styles, and unique image IDs mapped to image names. The purpose of this custom dataset is to extract the name or ID of the phone from the input image.

**Image Processing and Feature Extraction**

The following steps are taken to process the input image:

OpenCV is used to create bounding boxes around black features in the image.
Each feature within these boundaries is passed to the first model to extract the letter it represents.
The coordinates of the extracted letters are stored in separate arrays (e.g., h_coordinate for "H" and d_coordinate for "d").

**Extracting "Hello, World!"**

To reconstruct the complete phrase "Hello, World!" from the image, the following steps are taken:

Coordinates with the same base (presumably the baseline of the letters) are searched for.
By aligning the coordinates from the top of the h_coordinate to the bottom of the d_coordinate, the relevant portion of the image is extracted.
The image is then cropped using these coordinates.

**Second Model Prediction**

The cropped image is passed to the second model for prediction.

Note: You can add more details, such as the models used, the technology stack, and any dependencies required to run the project.
